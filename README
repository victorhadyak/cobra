AWS EC2 Session Manager CLI Tool
Description
As the bastion service will be decommissioned soon, this CLI tool has been prepared to facilitate easy connection to desired EC2 instances in our AWS account. It simplifies the process of connecting to an instance using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager, abstracting the need to manage SSH keys or bastion hosts.

Prerequisites
AWS CLI installed and configured with necessary permissions.
Go installed if you wish to build from source (optional).
Installation
Downloading the Executable
Go to the Releases page of this repository.
Download the appropriate executable for your Mac:
For Intel-based Mac users: Download ssm-cli from the macos-amd64 directory.
For Apple M1 Mac users: Download ssm-cli from the macos-arm64 directory.
Adding to PATH
Move the downloaded ssm-cli to a suitable directory, for example, /usr/local/bin:
mv path/to/downloaded/ssm-cli /usr/local/bin/ssm-cli
Ensure that /usr/local/bin is in your PATH. You can check this by running:

echo $PATH
If /usr/local/bin is not in your PATH, you can add it by adding the following line to your ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bashrc, or ~/.zshrc:


export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
After adding it, you may need to reload your profile or open a new terminal window to apply the changes.

Usage
To connect to an EC2 instance:
ssm-cli connect <instance-id>
To generate a session:


ssm-cli generate
AWS Commands Used
This tool internally uses the following AWS CLI commands:

To list available AWS regions:

sh
Copy code
aws ec2 describe-regions --query "Regions[].RegionName" --output text
To describe EC2 instances in a specific region:

sh
Copy code
aws ec2 describe-instances --region <region> --instance-ids <instance-id>
To start an AWS Systems Manager Session Manager session:

sh
Copy code
aws ssm start-session --target <instance-id> --region <region>
